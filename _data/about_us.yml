      quote: |-
        I'm Vlad, the founder of this initiative. I started it because this is the best idea
        I have for making a positive impact on the future of humanity.
        In 2010 I got my bachelor's, and in 2013 my master's degree in Physics,
        from the Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca.
        Since 2011 I've been working in tech companies, both in startups and larger corporations.

#      quote: |-
#        The physics paradigm is constantly evolving.
#        For example, the speed of light was first conceived as infinite,
#        then it was measured to be finite; it was considered frame dependent in the
#        Newtonian classical mechanics, then it was found to be frame independent;
#        it is defined as a fundamental constant, while a lot of theories predict its variation.
#        The same story applies to energy, where we are in the era of energy-momentum conservation.
#        Infinite usable energy has been of great interest, for practical reasons obviously, as
#        evidenced by many hoax theories and bogus devices. It is invaluable to have an open-minded
#        project, like this one led by Vlad, that seeks the feasibility of such energy
#        sources within or beyond the current physics framework.
