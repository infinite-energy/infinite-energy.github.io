        The physics paradigm is constantly evolving.
        For example, the speed of light was first conceived as infinite,
        then it was measured to be finite; it was considered frame dependent in the
        Newtonian classical mechanics, then it was found to be frame independent;
        it is defined as a fundamental constant, while a lot of theories predict its variation.
        The same story applies to energy, where we are in the era of energy-momentum conservation.
        Infinite usable energy has been of great interest, for practical reasons obviously, as
        evidenced by many hoax theories and bogus devices. It is invaluable to have an open-minded
        project, like this one led by Vlad, that seeks the feasibility of such energy
        sources within or beyond the current physics framework.
