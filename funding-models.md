This section describes how we plan to help researchers get
funds.

# Funding models
All of these funding models are currently unavailable, but
we're working hard to make them real.
1. Through other institutions
2. By awarding grants
3. By directly hiring researchers

# Explanations
1. Funding through other institutions happens when
The Infinite Energy Initiative convinces other 
institutions to fund areas of research listed 
[here](/physics-research/) . When that happens, The Infinite
Energy Initiative could assist researchers in applying for
grants to those institutes which have allocated funds for
those research directions. This funding model is currently
not available, but it is our current area of focus.
2. Directly awarding grants works by having researchers
create research project proposals, and apply for grants
directly to The Infinite Energy Initiative. We will then
evaluate the projects, and award grants accordingly. This
funding model is currently unavailable, and though our 
current focus is to work with other grant awarding 
institutions, this model might be available at a later 
point
3. Funding research can also be done when The Infinite
Energy Initiative hires researchers directly (as temporary
or permanent employees) with the purpose of doing research
in the directions mentioned [here](/physics-research/) .
At the moment, this model of funding is unavailable. We're
working on making it real, but keep in mind, our current
focus is to work with the help of other institutions.
