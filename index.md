# We are aware this sounds completely insane

> Live forever, or die trying.

Yes, this sounds insane. Physics has been extremely 
clear on the law of conservation of energy so far. 
However, since Physics has not yet provided us with 
a complete understanding of the Universe, 
we think it's our moral obligation to look for a 
source of infinite energy. 
This will allow our civilization to continue in 
some form, forever. This gives us a powerful sense of
meaning. More about this, [here](/2023/04/16/why-we-want-infinite-energy/).

## Why do we think infinite energy is possible?
One reason to hope is because the Universe exists. 
Let us not forget that the world we live in has no 
currently known origin. Whatever caused the Big Bang, 
or even if it caused itself, is a reason to believe 
that this process could be reproduced, controlled 
and mastered, maybe even an infinite amount of times.
