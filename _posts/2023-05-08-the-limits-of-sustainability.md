Sustainability is an important idea. Superficially, 
it makes a lot of sense, but ultimately, whether we're 
consuming energy or resources slowly or fast,
we're going to run out of them at some point.

### A little history of the earth
The history of Earth is interesting. There have been 
a lot of species that lived here and then went extinct.
They were driven to extinction by a multitude of factors,
among which: climate, other species, disease, volcanoes,
asteroids, atmospheric composition etc.

Humans arrived on the scene relatively recently. Since
our arrival, we have slowly at first killed off a large
part of the bigger animals (see Yuval Noah Harari's book 
"Sapiens"). Lately, the speed at which 
species go extinct has accelerated to such a degree
that we're calling the current moment the 6th mass
extinction.


### Equilibrium in nature
In common vocabulary, there's a notion of "equilibrium
in nature" floating around. What could be meant by it?

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as:
> a state of balance between opposing forces or 
> actions that is either static (as in a body acted on 
> by forces whose resultant is zero) or dynamic 
> (as in a reversible chemical reaction when the 
> rates of reaction in both directions are equal)

This does not help us much, but based on the biological
history of Earth, we can at most say that "equilibrium" 
can refer to a state where some species go extinct, and 
others appear at rates close to their averages. That's 
how life on Earth appears to work: it's dynamic, and 
irreversible. Species go extinct and new ones appear, 
and we can't get the extinct ones back.

### Humans and nature
In the book "Sapiens" the author, Yuval Noah Harari, claims
that actually, since around 70 thousand years ago, humans
have slowly but surely exterminated most large species
of animals. He claims that the fact that most bigger animal
species live in Africa, shows how we actually killed 
off most of the other animals on the other continents.

So even if we think with nostalgia about times when humans
were better integrated with nature, we still
need to conclude that we were simply being slower at
forcing species to go extinct than we are today.

### The problems of circular economies
The European Parliament defines a circular economy like this:
>The circular economy is a model of production and 
> consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, 
> repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials 
> and products as long as possible. In this way, the life 
> cycle of products is extended.
> In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. 
> When a product reaches the end of its life, its 
> materials are kept within the economy wherever possible 
> thanks to recycling. These can be productively used 
> again and again, thereby creating further value.
 
While this is a great idea, ultimately it has a few problems:
1. For practical purposes, no material can ever be 
recycled 100%. Sure, metal can be melted, and recast, but
purely by chance, pieces of it will be lost. The European
Union classifies some materials as 
[critical raw materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Raw_Materials_Act)
If we ever lose these critical materials, we'll lose 
the technologies that they enable.
It's imaginable how losing a phone will take away some small
amount of critical raw materials. It's also imaginable how 
mining more of that material, might not be possible at some
point. It's also imaginable how when organic materials are 
washed away by rain and reach the ocean, a small amount of
phosphorus is lost with them. The effort to recover that 
phosphorus from the ocean will be higher than the benefit
gained. At that point, we'll have practically lost a key
element for life. In any case, making the point that we could
forever recycle every material is very hard because of 
entropy: atoms mix slowly with each other, and at some
point, rare elements will be so spread out, that we'd have
to turn the surface of the planet inside-out, looking 
for materials atom-by-atom. This doesn't even take into
account losing materials to outer-space.
2. To even be able to recycle, we need energy and resources.
Keep in mind though that we'll be increasingly losing 
resources, while at the same time, requiring more and more 
energy for recycling. In time, more energy will be required
because as with anything, we're recycling first the things
easier to recycle. At some point, mining will become
difficult enough, that it will simply be easier to start
going through the garbage produced in the past, in order
to find recyclable things
3. The planet itself will become uninhabitable at some
point, because of many kinds of problems. Wikipedia
keeps a list of these events in 
[timeline of the far future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)
I will mention here slowly decreasing CO2 levels (a problem
in opposition to climate change because of CO2), and
the sun turning into a red giant and swallowing the earth.
4. At some point, either energy, or some resource will
become exhausted. Even if we manage to survive as a society
around other stars, like red dwarves, the last red dwarf 
will eventually die out. If we master fusion, the idea 
stays the same, we will run out of fuel to use for fusion.

In the end, even if we're as conservative as possible
with our resources, we'll run out of energy to use them.

The conclusion is problematic for the idea of sustainability:
1. Sustainability did not exist before humans existed 
on the planet. Nature just worked, because it happened
to have enough resources and energy for some time
2. Our ancestors have not been acting sustainably. They
accelerated the destruction of species to levels higher
than those species were replaced
3. We're far from sustainable now
4. Even if we manage to be sustainable in the future,
energy and materials will not last forever

Ultimately, finding a source if infinite energy is a 
solution to these problems, that will allow some life forms
in the future to go on forever, always having as many 
resources and energy as they want. They could be our 
descendents. They will not be sustainable, they will not
be in equilibrium, they will just keep growing their 
societies forever.
