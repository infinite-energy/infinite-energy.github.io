# Fundamental Physics research directions
This section describes the types of Physics research 
supported by The Infinite Energy Initiative. If you have
any other ideas, feel free to contact us.
1. Direction 1: Answering the question <b>"Where in known physics could
we find a source of infinite energy?"</b>. 
2. Direction 2: Answering the question <b>"If an infinite source of energy 
existed, what constraints would that impose on known & 
unknown physics, and how could we test these 
constraints?"</b>. 
3. Direction 3: <b>Research directly related to finding infinite energy.</b>
4. Direction 4: <b>Research related to sources of energy we could use for 
finite amount of time (while we search for a infinite source of energy)</b>

## Examples
1. For direction #1, examples of 
research work would be surveying Quantum
Mechanics and General Relativity for places where the
math at least, allows for infinite energy to be accessed.
2. For direction #2, examples of research work could be
the development of Mathematical theorems
(similar to Noether's theorem, but concerning infinities,
not symmetries). Research into string theory, with the 
purpose of finding infinite energy could also be an example.
3. For direction #3, traversable wormholes and warp-drives
could be a good research topic. Also, research on whether 
the universe is infinite, or on parallel universes can 
be considered.
4. Direction #4 is a support plan for the other directions.
It is conceivable that we find that all our energy sources
will run out before we find an intinite one. If this is the
case, it makes sense to find another source of finite energy
that will support our society, while we continue to try 
searching for an infinite source.
